    "description": "Released in 1990, Painkiller is a thunderous declaration of Judas Priest\u2019s place at the pinnacle of heavy metal. Opening with Scott Travis's iconic double-kick drum assault, the track explodes into blistering guitars, Halford\u2019s piercing vocals, and apocalyptic lyricism. A relentless speed metal anthem, it marked a reinvention of the band\u2019s sound and remains one of their most celebrated tracks. Painkiller isn\u2019t just a song \u2014 it\u2019s a war cry for metal fans.",
